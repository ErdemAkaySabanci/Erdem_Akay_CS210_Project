MY LETTERBOXD PROFILE ANALYSIS
  
  This project is all about exploring the movies I've enjoyed using the Letterboxd website, where I've been tracking my film-watching adventures for the past 3 years. Letterboxd keeps tabs on the movies I've seen, how I've rated them, and what other viewers think. I used all this data to dig deep into my movie preferences and see what interesting patterns and connections I could find.

  I used a tool called Jupyter Notebooks to analyze the data and create cool charts. The main goal was to figure out what types of movies or directors I like, how I rate them, and if my tastes match up with other people on Letterboxd. The project turned out to be a fun way to learn more about my movie habits and see if there are any surprises in the data.

  In summary, it's a personal journey into the world of movies, exploring what I like and how it compares to others. The charts and numbers help tell the story of my movie-watching adventure!
